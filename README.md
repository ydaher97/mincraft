# Minecraft JavaScript Game

This project is an implementation of a simplified version of Minecraft in a 2D environment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can interact with the pre-generated 2D world, use tools to remove tiles, store them in an inventory, and place them back in the world.

## Features

1. **Tools:**
   - Axe: Used for cutting trees.
   - Pickaxe: For mining rocks.
   - Shovel: Used to dig dirt.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Clicking on a tool followed by a tile removes the tile if it matches the tool type and adds it to the inventory.
   - Placing tiles from the inventory back into the world.

## Project Structure

### HTML Structure
- Contains containers for the game board, tools, materials, and inventory.
- Landing page with a tutorial explaining game mechanics.

### CSS Styling
- Defines the layout, styling, and themes for the game elements.
- Implements responsive design for various screen sizes.

### JavaScript Logic
- Generates the pre-determined 2D world grid.
- Handles user interactions, tool usage, inventory management, and tile placement.

## Basic Requirements

1. **Implementation:**
   - All features implemented as specified in the requirements.
2. **Version Control:**
   - Git used throughout the project with regular commits.
3. **UI/UX:**
   - UI designed to match or exceed the provided demo's quality.
4. **Landing Page:**
   - Includes a landing page with a tutorial explaining game mechanics.
5. **Reset Functionality:**

## Tips and Recommendations

- **CSS Usage:** Utilizes CSS classes instead of dynamic CSS property changes in JavaScript.
- **Backgrounds:** Uses the `background-image` property for tiles instead of `<img>` tags.
- **Code Organization:** Logic separated into distinct functions for modularity.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Different files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
